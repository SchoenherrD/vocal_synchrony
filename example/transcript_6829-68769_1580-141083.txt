3;IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
5;I CANNOT SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
7;IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
9;BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY MERE BLUFF
11;HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DID NOT STOP TO COUNT THE COST
13;IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
15;BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
17;FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY JAIL
19;THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
21;WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK
23;I AM RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
25;OH SAY THAT IS DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEANOR
27; MAY WE SEE GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
29;THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES 
31;SOMETIMES I AM THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I AM NEARLY CRAZY AN I DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS WORST DYING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
33;NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
35;I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU
37;YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
39;SO IT SEEMS TO ME
41;NOW MISTER SOAMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
43;ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
45;THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
47;THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE 
49;I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
51;ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
53;YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
55;THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
57;AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOAMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
59;HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
62;THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
64;HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
67;SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
69;HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
71;WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
73;I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
75;AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
77;HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLO WHAT IS THIS
79;HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
81;WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
83;I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
85;AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES 
87;ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
89;LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
91;MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
93;THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MC LAREN
95;I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
97;HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
99;BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
101;DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
103;HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
106;ANYONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
108; I REALLY DO NOT THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOLMES
110;ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
113;OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY 
116;YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR

2;I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
4;I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
6;MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
8;WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
10;I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
12;I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
14;THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
16;THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
18;THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
20;THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
22;I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
24;A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
26;NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
28;ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
30;TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
32;DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE 
34;HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE IS VISITORS TOM
38;WORSE TOM WORSE N EVER REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
40;MISS DE GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
42;SORRY WE HAVE NOT ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
44;SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE IS A BENCH HERE
46;A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
48;WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
50; I DID NOT STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I AM GLAD I DID
52;OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
54;THEN ROGERS WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
56;HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
58;WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHECK ASKED KENNETH
61;IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
63;IT IS A STOCK COMPANY AND RICH
65;I WAS BOOKKEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
68;AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I WILL SAY THAT I SAVED THEM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
70;I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
72;IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
74;I AM GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
76;IT WILL NOT BE MUCH BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
78;THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
80; I HAVE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY
82;AND IT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
84;HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
86;SOME GIRL HAS BEEN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
88;I AM NOT ELECTIONEERING JUST NOW
90;OH WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM
92;AND HE DESERVES A TERM IN STATE'S PRISON
94;IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYANCE
96;I WILL PAY ALL THE COSTS BESIDES 
98;YOU ARE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
100;I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHALL
102;GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I WILL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
105;HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES 
107;BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUDGED HIM
109;THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE
112;HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
115;TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
